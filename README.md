# Astro Photo Grid

## Features

- **Responsive, justified grid using modern CSS.** All layout and reflow logic is handled with pure CSS—no JS required for positioning!
- **Automatic lightbox integration.** Images open in a full-screen preview using [Fancybox](https://fancyapps.com/fancybox/), which includes swipe, drag, pinch-to-zoom, and a customizable toolbar.
- **Optimized image loading and sizing.** Images on the grid are optimized using Astro's [`<Image />` component](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/). Images on the grid beyond the first screen are lazily loaded.
